# From a request to a workflow

## 1. Name the trigger and the caller
- Someone clicks in the app → `endpoint`. Short and interactive (a lookup, a triage) → `mode: sync`; anything with a
  human gate, an external write or more than a few seconds → `mode: async` and the front polls with `useRun`.
- Runs on its own → `schedule` with `schedule_as` (a service account whose roles decide what stores and connectors allow).
- Called from another workflow → no trigger needed; the parent uses `step.workflow`.
- `allow.roles`: the app roles that may start it. The caller's roles are what stores and `auth = principal`
  connectors see; a step a role may not perform fails at run time and shows in `cori run --user`.

## 2. Parameters
Only what the caller knows at click time. Everything else is looked up in a step. Optional inputs get `required:
false`; enumerations get `type: enum` with `values`; ids are `string`. The description is the form label.

## 3. One step per fact or effect
Write the list of top-level steps in execution order, then pick a kind for each:

| Need | Kind |
|---|---|
| read or write a company system through its MCP server | `mcp` (scaffold it) |
| read or write the app's own data | `store` (tool for one row by key, `query` for a filtered set) |
| an HTTP API the org declared | `http` |
| a rule, a threshold, a mapping, a merge, a count | `code` |
| classify, extract, summarise, draft free text | `llm` with a fixed zod `output` and the smallest tier that works |
| a person must decide or provide something | `human` inside a `branch` so it only runs when needed |
| the same thing for each element | `map` (child workflow when each element is a whole workflow) |
| an action that may fail and needs a fallback | `try` |
| existing Go/C#/Java code on a team's worker | `activity` |
| a CLI on the sandbox | `cli` |

Rules of thumb:
- **Decisions in `code`, never in prompts.** An `llm` step labels or drafts; the next `code` step decides from the
  label, the confidence and typed data. The decision is then auditable, testable and free.
- **One effect per step.** A step that writes twice cannot be retried safely. Split writes; let `steps:` order them.
- **Read early, write late.** Reads have no order constraint and run in parallel; writes follow `steps:`. Put every
  read before the first write so a failure leaves nothing half-done.
- **Gate before the write it protects**, and give the gate a `timeout` and an `on_timeout` default that is the safe
  choice (usually "not approved").
- **Idempotency.** Writes started from a form: `idempotency: parameters` or `header` with one key per form
  instance. Reads, and writes a user repeats on purpose (a status toggled back and forth): `none`. Unset, reads get
  `none` and writes `parameters`; set it explicitly on every write. A store `create` on an existing key fails: `try` it when a replay is possible.
- **Parallelism is free.** Two steps that only depend on earlier steps run together; do not merge them into one step
  to "save a call".
- **Child workflows** for reuse and fan-out; a child's gates and effects are its own and show in the parent's review.

## 4. Data shapes
- Put schemas used by several steps in `types.ts`; keep step-local ones inline.
- Narrow `output` schemas: `z.enum`, `z.number().min().max()`, `.max(2000)` on drafts. Downstream types and the LLM's
  contract both come from them.
- A `map` yields `{ items }`; a `code` step after it computes counts and groups for `result`.
- `result.headline` reads dotted paths only: precompute anything else in a `code` step named for the reader
  (`outcome`, `summary`).

## 5. Privacy and effects
- Tag `pii` columns in `rules.yaml`; keep them out of `readable` for roles that do not need them; `redact:` the
  fields a step must carry (a ticket body that feeds an `llm` step, for instance).
- Check the `effects` line of `cori check`: every `MayWrite` is a line in the change review and a reason for an
  approver. If a write surprises you, the tool annotation or the store role says so.
- Budget: `budget: { llm_eur_per_run, max_duration }` when the workflow calls a model or may wait on a human.

## 6. Fixtures and verification
- Write the fixture with the step: the tool result you expect, the rows a query returns, the JSON an `llm` step should
  produce. The first `cori run` then exercises the real dataflow.
- Cover both arms of every `branch` (`--decide`, different parameters) and one failure of every `try`.
- Store steps: one run against the real store (`cori up`) before deploying, because fixtures return rows without
  running SQL.
- Put the goal, the dataflow sketch and the verification checklist in the workflow's `README.md`; that is what the
  next person (or agent) reads.

## 7. Hand-off
`cori deploy .` gives a preview url on the version's own sandbox stores. Tell the user what to try there, what the
change review lists, and the `cori promote <app> <hash>` command. Promotion, approval and rollback are theirs.
